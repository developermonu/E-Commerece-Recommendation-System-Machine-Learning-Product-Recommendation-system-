# E-Commerce Recommendation System

A machine learning product recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches to recommend products to users.

## Dockerized Application

This project is containerized using Docker, with two containers:
1. **Database container** - MySQL database
2. **Web application container** - Flask application

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Running the Application with Docker

#### Option 1: Build and Run in One Step (Previous Method)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Option 2: Build Images Separately and Then Run (Recommended)
1. Build the Docker images first:
   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac
   ./build.sh
   
   # On Windows
   build.bat
   ```

2. Start the containers using the pre-built images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Access the application:
   Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

4. To stop the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Docker Images

This project uses two custom Docker images:

- **recommender-webapp:latest** - Contains the Flask application with all dependencies
- **recommender-db:latest** - Contains MySQL with initialized tables for user data

### Architecture

- **Webapp Container**: 
  - Flask application serving the web interface
  - Machine learning models for recommendations
  - Connected to MySQL database

- **Database Container**:
  - MySQL 8.0
  - Stores user sign-up and sign-in data
  - Data persists through Docker volumes

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be modified in the docker-compose.yml file:

- `MYSQL_HOST`: Database hostname (default: db)
- `MYSQL_USER`: Database username (default: root)
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: Database password (default: root)
- `MYSQL_DB`: Database name (default: ecom)

## Features

## Introduction

In today's digital era, e-commerce platforms are becoming increasingly popular, offering a vast array of products to consumers worldwide. However, with the abundance of choices, it can be overwhelming for users to find products that match their preferences. To address this challenge, implementing a recommendation system can significantly enhance the user experience by providing personalized product suggestions. In this article, we'll explore the process of building an e-commerce recommendation system using Flask and machine learning techniques, including content-based, collaborative filtering, hybrid, and multi-model recommendations.

## Understanding Recommendation Systems

Recommendation systems are algorithms designed to predict user preferences and suggest items that they are likely to enjoy.
There are several types of recommendation systems, including content-based, collaborative filtering, and hybrid approaches.
- Content-based recommendation systems analyze item attributes and user preferences to recommend similar items.
- Collaborative filtering recommendation systems rely on user behavior data, such as ratings and interactions, to make predictions.
- Hybrid recommendation systems combine multiple approaches to provide more accurate and diverse recommendations.
- Multi-model recommendation systems leverage different machine learning models to cater to various user preferences and item characteristics.

## Building the Recommendation System

- We'll start by collecting and preprocessing the e-commerce dataset, including product attributes, user ratings, and interactions.
- Next, we'll implement content-based recommendation algorithms to suggest products based on their features and user preferences.
- We'll then develop collaborative filtering models using techniques like matrix factorization and neighborhood-based methods to predict user-item interactions.
- To enhance recommendation accuracy and coverage, we'll create hybrid models that combine content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.
- Additionally, we'll explore multi-model recommendation strategies, integrating multiple machine learning models to provide diverse recommendations.
- Throughout the development process, we'll utilize Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for data manipulation, model training, and evaluation.

## Integrating with Flask and E-Commerce Website

- After building the recommendation system, we'll integrate it with a Flask web application to provide a user-friendly interface.
- The Flask application will include features such as user registration, product browsing, search functionality, and recommendation display.
- We'll leverage Flask's routing capabilities to handle user requests and render dynamic web pages with personalized recommendations.
- Furthermore, we'll implement user authentication and session management to ensure a secure and seamless browsing experience.
- The e-commerce website will feature product cards displaying essential information, including images, descriptions, prices, and ratings.
- Users will have the option to interact with the recommendation system by providing feedback, such as ratings and likes, to improve future recommendations.

## Conclusion

Building an e-commerce recommendation system with Flask and machine learning techniques offers numerous benefits, including enhanced user engagement, increased sales, and improved customer satisfaction. By leveraging content-based, collaborative filtering, hybrid, and multi-model recommendation approaches, businesses can deliver personalized product suggestions tailored to individual user preferences. Integrating the recommendation system with a Flask-based e-commerce website provides a seamless shopping experience, empowering users to discover relevant products efficiently. As e-commerce continues to evolve, implementing advanced recommendation systems remains a valuable strategy for driving growth and fostering customer loyalty in the digital marketplace.

By following this comprehensive guide, developers can embark on their journey to create sophisticated recommendation systems and elevate the e-commerce experience for users worldwide.
